## Introduction

This project is made using the Java programming language. It uses JavaFX, which allows developers to create graphical user interfaces using a declarative markup language called FXML. For data persistence, this project uses a SQL database system to store and retrieve data.

The main function/purpose of this project is to simulate a movie seat ticket booking system, allowing users to view available movies, buy tickets by booking seats for a movie, as well as viewing their reservations.

*NOTE: This program does not work outside of my own device, as it uses my local SQL Database. So, I have attatched a video demo bellow.
